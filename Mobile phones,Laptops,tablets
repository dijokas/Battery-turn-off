I will explain this in very simple way. 

Let’s call this solution: “Battery turn off solution”

How must it work:

The solution is for Laptops and I believe Mobile phones, tablets or any other device’s.

So as soon device is plugged in to the electricity outlet the battery must turn off if doesn’t require a charge or as soon charge is complete the batter must turn off and device will must use only power from main supply and not from the battery. 

It is very similar to power tools as soon the battery charged, charger turning off. 
So it means if take of battery it will work any way, and if turn of the plug the device will stop work.
Some people do use all the time chargers and batteries do work all the time the batteries being hot. 
I believe some people will need to have “Make sure” devise working solution so in case main plug is off the battery turning on, and only then turning on if main charging is off. So automatic solution will make less production of batteries and obviously is green solution it is important saving Earth solution.
